# webRTC-1
Basic webRTC for 2 person video chatting
Used langauge : Node Js and Javascript for browsers
server is just yused for connection once connected its the two browsers which do the communication, meaning after connection if the server is turned off still the RTC will happen!

Lot of companies like MSTEAMS,google meet,campk12,whitehat jr use the same technology for real time technology!

# Take aways
I was mind blown by the power of our browsers and JS lang!

# Future Scopes
This project can be used for facial detection and saving the results in the database instead of analysing the video in the serverside, everything can be done in client side
Also, this is only for 1-1 connection, can be made for many-many!
PS: this code has a probable deadlock condition, if rectifed I will update it
